Hours spent:
First shot at Vig breaker 2/13: 2.5 hrs
IDing the ciphers and working on Vig breaker 2/19: 3 hrs
2/27 5:30 - 9:40: 4.5 hrs 
    Had to code a way to collect arrays of all possible caesar keys within a certain tolerances for each key length
    then I had take those and iterate out all into all possible key combinations
    I then realized that my isEngligh checker was the bottleneck for the code to run in a reasonable time
    had to try and speed that up by not searching the  dictionary of words, instead searched top 1000 words
    had to play with caesar tolerances in order to benchmark the run time to be something reasonable
    program hit cloud9 memory limit due to the size of the all possible key combinations array, increased to 1GB (max for free ver)
    modified english checker to include top 1k quad-grams and improve the accuracy
    after much frustration, just let it run overnight and came back with the answer! also confirmed Secret 2 and not 4 was the Vin Cipher
    Note that I didnt pipe output to a file, so the top part of my terminal was lost, also the program died at some point due to OOM
    so it is very fortunate that the answer was within the remaining part of the terminal AND before the program had OOM

1) Substitution (secret3)
    should not have normal letter frequencies
    letter frequencies squared should sum to .065
2) Vigenere
    will have a key length between 10 and 20 that has SFS = .065
3) Play Fair
    Will have no J's
4) Column Transposition (secret5)
    should have normal letter frequencies
    letter frequencies  squared should sum to .065
5) Hill 2x2
    Last one by process of elimination
    
    
The first step was to determine which cipher cooresponded to which blackhat challenge.

Secret5 is only 15% off from normal english letter frequencies,
AND the sum of the frequencies squared is .069 which is very close to the .065 of normal english.
It is probably the column transposition cipher.

Secret3 has a sum of its frequencies squared at .066, but does not have normal letter frequencies.
Therefore, it is probably the substitution cipher.

Secret1 has no J's and therefore is the Play Fair Cipher

Either Secret2 or secret4 is the vigenere and hill 2x2 cipher.
