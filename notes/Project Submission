Please answer these questions in an email to your_udel_username_here@crypto.prof.ninja

I want to know about your growth. Even if the project is a group project I want each person to tell me the following:

What is your project?
Where can I run it? (Do I need some files downloaded?)
Who did you work with? If part of a group, how would you describe your role?
What grade would you give yourself (out of 100)?
How many hours did you work on this?
List your "a-ha" moments. (When something useful clicked for you.)
What parts of your project do you wish to improve?
What is your overall impression of the experience? Which skills do you want to keep in your future?
